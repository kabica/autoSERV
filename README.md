## autoSERV
API serving start-up code for all things Web Developer 

### Foundation Idea
 - An app that generates and delivers the start-up and initializaton code required for various developer projects. 
 - Auto-complete is a term that will be used to describe how independent / sentient the app will appear to be.
 - Low levels of auto-complete will enable users to request a chunk of generic code, much like they would be able to find on the internet but with the convenience of bieng centralized in one location (control-c + control-v in nature)
 - High levels of autocomplete will allow users to specify route handlers and potential responses (think static JSON content for simple html templating)
 - Code library is polled based on user specified requirements (Express start-up, Routes start-up, etc.)
    - TIER I = simple serve 
    - TIER II = allow for user specified metrics 
    - TIER III = code is served along with React components for future display
